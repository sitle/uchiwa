## Installation

* Checkout the source: `git clone git@github.com:palourde/uchiwa.git`
* Install bower on your system: `npm install -g bower` 
* Install the dependencies: `npm install`

## Getting Started

* Copy **config.js.example** to **config.js** - modify your Sensu API information. See configuration section below
* Start the dashboard: `node app.js`
* Browse your browser: `http://localhost:3000/`

### Migration from 0.0.x to 0.1.x

With the support of mutiple Sensu APIs, the configuration structure has been modified. To configure multiple APIs, simply refer yourself to the **config.js.example** file.

Also make sure to run `npm install` to install any missing dependencies.

### Use nginx as proxy

The first thing you need is Nginx **1.3.13** or higher, since previous versions do not support websocket connections.

Then, you simply need to open up the Nginx configuration file and add the following route to your virtual server:
```
location / {
  proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
  proxy_http_version 1.1;
  proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
  proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
  proxy_set_header Host $host;
}
```

In case you want the dashboard to be accessible within a certain path on the proxy, let's say /uchiwa, simply use the following block instead:
```
 location ~ (/uchiwa/|/socket.io/) {
  proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
  proxy_http_version 1.1;
  proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
  proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
  proxy_set_header Host $host;

  rewrite /uchiwa/(.*) /$1 break;
}
```
